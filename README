PIANO(6)                         Games Manual                         PIANO(6)

NAME
     piano – musical keyboard

SYNOPSIS
     piano [-p] [-a amplitude] [-b base-freq] [-d duration] [-t timbre]

DESCRIPTION
     The piano program plays musical notes as you press keys on the keyboard.
     Pressing a key produces a note for one beat. "q" produces the lowest note
     and "m" produces the highest note. Notes between "q" and "m" are each a
     half step apart, ordered as they appear on a QWERTY keyboard. The space
     (" ") character produces a rest (silence). Entering digits before a note
     or rest causes the note or rest to be that many beats long. Entering some
     number of "+" or "-" before a note brings the note up or down that many
     octaves. Wrapping multiple notes in backticks (``) plays the enclosed
     notes simultaneously.

     The options to piano are as follows:

     -a amplitude
             Volume percentage. Must be a value between 0 and 100.

     -b base-freq
             Frequency of the lowest note ("q"). Each subsequent note is a
             half step higher than the last.

     -d duration
             The duration (in milliseconds) of a beat.

     -p      Use a piano-like layout instead of the default ascending QWERTY
             layout.  Keys in the middle keyboard row act as the white keys on
             a piano and keys in the top row act as the black keys. Some keys
             on the bottom row have values but they're not standard.

     -t timbre
             The timbre (sound quality) to use. Must be one of ‘dialtone’,
             ‘sawtooth’, ‘sine’, ‘triangle’, or ‘trumpet’ (the default).

EXAMPLES
     Tetris theme:

           $ echo 'z ghk hgd dhz khg ghk z h d 2d' | piano -d 150

     Megalovania:

           $ echo 'uul f2 d s p upsuul f2 d s p ups' | piano -t sawtooth

HISTORY
     Originally written on a Dell All-in-One running OpenBSD left in the
     authors' dorm common room. Lacking Wi-Fi drivers, piano was born out of a
     need for offline entertainment.  piano was later ported from OpenBSD's
     sndio(7) library to the cross-platform ‘libao’.
